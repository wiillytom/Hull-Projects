# **Hull Python Projects**
## *Objectives*
This repository contains the Python projects that I see fit for each of the chapter 
of the book Options, Futures and Other Derivatives by John C. Hull. \
\
These projects aim to help with the assimilation of the chapter's content, as well
as develop my programming skills.
\
Projects start on chapter 4 because I don't see any relevant projects for chapters 1-3, and the
content will be approached once more in the following chapters
